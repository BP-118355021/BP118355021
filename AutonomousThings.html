            <h2>Autonomous Things</h2>
     
        <p>Autonomous things is an emerging term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment as autonomous entities without human direction, freely moving and interacting with humans and other objects.  </p>
        <h3>Advantages Of Autonomous Things</h3>
     
        <p>
         The lack of human error whilst driving, will result in a much safer journey. Also due to the sensors on the Autonomous car, they will be able to pack closer together, allowing more cars on the road and therefore shorting traffic times 
        </p>
       
       
        <p>  Disabilities would no longer be a factor in driving, meaning anyone could drive</p>
        <h3>Disadvantages Of Autonomous Things</h3>
     
        <p>
               There will always be the worry of the computer crashing or malfunctioning, resulting in a major collision.
        </p>
       
       
        <p>The lack of need for drivers would be catastrophic for the economy; in 2011 there were 73,000 taxi drivers in England , who would all become unemployed. This would be common for all driving professions, including lorry drivers, bus drivers etc.</p>
