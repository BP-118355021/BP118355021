            <h2>Blockchain</h2>
     
        <p>Blockchain is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.</p>
        <h3>Advantages Of BlockChain</h3>
        <p>
            The blockchain technology allows for verification without having to be dependent on third-parties.
The data structure in a blockchain is append-only. So, the data cannot be altered or deleted.
It uses protected cryptography to secure the data ledgers. Also, the current ledger is dependent on its adjacent completed block to complete the cryptography process.
All the transactions and data are attached to the block after the process of maximum trust verification. There is a consensus of all the ledger participants on what is to be recorded in the block.
The transactions are recorded in chronological order. Thus, all the blocks in the blockchain are time stamped

        <h3>Precautions when businesses invest in the blockchain</h3>
        <p>All businesses that are keen to invest in blockchain technology must first perform a strategic evaluation to see if it is truly feasible for their business model. Many companies may not see a return on their investments in the initial years. Any unstructured implementation of the blockchain technology may lead to strategic failures. Thus, it is advised that companies perform granular assessments at the use-case level to determine which application can be induced with blockchain technology. The points where it can be applied has to be identified and its impact has to be assessed with specific use cases. A right strategic approach is what is needed to leverage the maximum benefits of blockchain technology.</p>
