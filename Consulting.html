        Consulting
    </h2> 
  
    <p> when it comes to consulting it is my dream job. i love helping my clients and sharing my knowledge and giving advice to them to help them to solve their problems.As a consultant, you will work directly for CEOs and their executive teams very early in your career. This will enable you to start developing a lot of the soft skills you will need to become a senior executive later on.
