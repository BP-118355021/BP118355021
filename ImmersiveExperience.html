            <h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
     
        <p>Immersive Experience such as Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. </p>
        <h3>Advantages Of Immersive Experience</h3>
        <h4>Conferencing</h4>
        <p>
          Think Skype for Business on steroids. VR has the potential to bring digital workers together in digital meetings and conferences. There will be real-time event coverage, something like Facebook Live with VR. Rather than merely seeing the other person on a screen, you’ll be able to feel as if you are in the same room with them, despite being miles away. With the rise of the freelancer economy, virtual meetings may become the norm rather than the exception.
        </p>
       
        <h4>Convenience</h4>
        <p>VR can save organizations time and money and make work more convenient. Workers won’t have to travel in order to make decisions and complete projects. For example, architects from across the globe can use virtual reality to evaluate designs. This alone is a monetary godsend. VR also opens the door for a virtual marketplace, where shoppers can try on garments, and you can see what that Arabian rug will look like in your den.</p>
