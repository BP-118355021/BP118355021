      </h2>
   
      <p>In fourth year of secondary school i went on a school tour to Paris in France. We went to the eiffle tower, disney and many more tourist attractions in paris. we went for 4 days and it was an unforgetable experience and will stick with me for life. i would recommend going to anyone who was interested.
